## Slide 2: The Problem

**(Layout: Left side has a large, bold question. Right side has three simple icons with text.)**

# How do we navigate the **ESG Data Labyrinth**?

DNB faces a massive challenge: sustainability data is...

| Icon (e.g., tangled ball of yarn) | Icon (e.g., magnifying glass over a document) | Icon (e.g., a clock with a spinning arrow) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Fragmented & Unstructured** | **Impossible to Manually Analyze at Scale** | **Too Slow for Proactive Risk Management** |

Analysts spend **80%** of their time searching for data and only **20%** analyzing it. This is slow, costly, and risks missing critical insights.

## Slide 3: Our Solution

**(Layout: A large, central hero shot of the Green Guardian logo or a friendly robot mascot. Text is clean and minimal.)**

# Introducing Green Guardian

An **AI-powered Sustainability Intelligence Platform** that acts as a copilot for every analyst at DNB.

Green Guardian transforms a chaotic ocean of unstructured data into a **single, queryable, and trustworthy source of truth.**

Ask a question in plain English. Get an answer grounded in your data. Instantly.

## Slide 4: How It Works (The Magic)

**(Layout: A simplified, clean architectural diagram in the center. Three key steps listed below.)**

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Unstructured Data"
        A[Sustainability Reports]
        B[News Feeds]
        C[Portfolio Data]
    end

    subgraph "Azure AI"
        D{Ingest, Chunk, & Index}
        E[Cognitive Search<br>Knowledge Base]
        F[Azure OpenAI<br>LLM Brain (GPT-4)]
    end

    subgraph "User"
        G[Analyst]
    end

    A & B & C --> D --> E
    G -- "Asks a question" --> F
    F -- "Reasons & Retrieves" --> E
    F -- "Generates a grounded, cited answer" --> G
```

1.  **We Ingest & Index:** All of DNB's sustainability data is fed into a secure knowledge base on Azure.
2.  **User Asks a Question:** An analyst asks a question in natural language.
3.  **AI Retrieves & Generates:** Our **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** agent retrieves the most relevant facts from the knowledge base and uses Azure OpenAI to generate a synthesized, accurate answer, complete with citations back to the source documents.
